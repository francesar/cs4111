We successfully completed every part of the original application, except that we chose to work with user submitted data instead of data from zillow. In terms of extra
functionality, we chose to show a map for representatives, so that they can view comments. 

The Feed page includes a bulk of the our database operations, where users can create, view, and filter out different comments that other users have made.
Here we used JOINS, WHERE, and UPDATE clauses that allow for complex interactions with our database objects. 

The map page was also interesting since it was the page where we had to interact with our database objects using front end javascript.
